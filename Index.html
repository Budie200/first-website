    <p>To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to play Among Us.
        The gameplay is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the mechanics will go over a typical player's head. 
        There's also the Imposter's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. 
        The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realise that they're not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE.
        As a consequence people who dislike Among Us truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in the crewmate's existential catchphrase "Sus," which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic Fathers and Sons. 
        I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Dan Harmon's genius wit unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools.. how I pity them. üòÇ
        And yes, by the way, i DO have an Among Us tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the ladies' eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand. Nothin personnel kid üòé
